Johannesburg - After months of speculation, the mystery Fanta flavour has been revealed. The carbonated soft drink created by Coca-Cola announced this week that the limited edition Fanta is raspberry and litchi flavour. Fanta announced the interactive #WhatTheFanta campaign which kept the public guessing from last year about the flavour of the beverage. “South Africa welcomed the #WhatTheFanta global campaign in August, much to the delight of curious consumers,” the beverage company explained. “The centrepiece of this interactive flavour-guessing campaign was a limited-edition, mysteriously flavoured Fanta® soft drink designed to challenge consumers’ senses and taste buds with contrasting flavour notes.” Fanta added that the announcement of its new raspberry and litchi flavour came after a “rigorous online experience” of clue cracking and flavour guessing.
