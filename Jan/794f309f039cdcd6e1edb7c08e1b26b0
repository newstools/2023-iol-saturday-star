IN A time when South Africans feel crippled by load shedding, Openview is  coming to the rescue. South Africa's first free-to-air satellite TV platform has launched Power-UP!, a pop-up entertainment channel of various beloved local shows. These include the likes of Afrikaans telenovela as well as omnibus repeats of all the best Afrikaans dramas during weekends. These shows will be available to watch for those who missed them during the week due to load shedding. “We’ve got you, South Africa, and as a brand of our own, we believe it’s the little things we do to support households that will make a difference in the long run,” Openview said. “Catch it when you catch it, as long as you catch it – with 18 hours daily of local dramas, Power-UP! is the new pop-up channel that ensures viewers never miss a show  again – no matter how your load shedding schedule changes.” The pop-up channel will be on Channel 114 on Openview and will be available from Monday.
